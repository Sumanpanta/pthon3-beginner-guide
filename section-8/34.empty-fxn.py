#you don't know whether you will be writing the code or your friend will: but insync
# you decide this are going to be fxn in our sdk, but we will be filling them later on.


#when ever you dont have defination for fxn you know the name in this case of empty fxn 
#just use "pass" this is only way and wont show error
